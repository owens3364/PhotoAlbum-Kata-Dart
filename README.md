To Run Main Application
1) Install Dart with `brew install dart`
2) Run `main.dart` with `dart lib/main.dart`

To Run Tests
1) Run `dart test`

That's it!

Don't want to install Dart?
You can still run the application on Windows via `bin/main.exe`.
Running on other platforms would require that you install the dartaotruntime tool,
and at that point you may as well just install Dart.
